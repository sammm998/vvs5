"""A second reader for cases the drawing leaves genuinely open - bounded, verified, and never load-bearing.

The engine answers from the sheet's own geometry. Where it can defend an answer it does not ask anyone, and
where it cannot it says AMBIGUOUS. That is the whole design and this module does not change it. What it adds is
narrow: for a case the engine itself has already declared ambiguous, and where the drawing offers a short list
of real candidates, a language model may say which of THOSE it reads - and its answer is then checked against
the same list before anything happens.

Four properties, each enforced here rather than asked for:

  * **Bounded.** A question carries the candidates the engine found. `verify` refuses any answer that is not one
    of them, character for character. A model cannot name a designation, a family or a run that the reading did
    not already put forward, so it cannot invent a pipe, a leader, a DN, a coordinate or a metre.
  * **Only where the engine gave up.** `settle` never sees a confirmed case. Nothing it returns can overturn a
    reading the engine could defend; it can only turn AMBIGUOUS into one of the answers already on the table.
  * **Optional and offline by default.** Without an `ask` callable this module answers nothing, so the engine is
    deterministic, runs with no network, and produces the same takeoff it always did. Determinism tests and the
    contamination firewall are unaffected because nothing here is reached unless a caller passes a transport.
  * **Its own answer is evidence, not authority.** Every settled case records that a model chose it, from which
    candidates, and why, so a reader can see it and disagree.

Nothing in this module opens a file, a drawing or a reference takeoff. It is given text the caller
already holds, and it hands back a choice among strings the caller supplied.
