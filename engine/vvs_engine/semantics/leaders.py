"""Actual CAD leader discovery.

A leader is a chain of real PDF stroke segments that starts at an annotation block boundary (underline end,
box corner, block bbox corner) and leaves the block. Families (segment count, bends, start type, end marker,
crossing ticks) are discovered per drawing. No synthetic association rays are ever created.
