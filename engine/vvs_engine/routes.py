"""Reading the same drawing by more than one route, and saying where the routes disagree.

One reading can be wrong in a way it cannot see: a leader that lands on the wrong line names the wrong run, and
nothing inside that reading contradicts it. So the sheet is read again by a route that uses different evidence,
and the answers are put side by side. Where two routes name the same geometry the same way, the reading is
corroborated. Where they name it differently, the run is ambiguous and stays out of the quantity. Where only one
route reaches a run, that is said plainly rather than hidden inside a number.

There are two independent ways a drawing says which run a label names, and one way of carrying an identity
further than either of them said:

  pointing   the label's own leader, traced to the geometry it touches or the symbol it ends at
  writing    the label written along the run - parallel to it, beside it, spanning it, and alone on it
  closure    an identity continuing through a junction, or over a layer that names one system: not a second
             reading at all but the first one carried on, so metres reached only this way are counted as such

A route may add a run the others missed, and it may contradict one - which makes the run ambiguous. It may never
rename a run another route confirmed, because then the two readings would no longer be independent.
