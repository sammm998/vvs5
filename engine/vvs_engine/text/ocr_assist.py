"""OCR-assisted resolution of characters the stroke recogniser could not name.

The vector reading owns the result: it reads the drawing's own geometry. Where a glyph's shape matches no
reference letter, though, the row is left with a '?' and everything built on it - the designation, its dimension,
the pipe it labels - is lost. This pass renders the page once, reads it with OCR, and fills in only those unknown
positions, and only when the OCR word lines up character for character with what the vector reader already read.
Every character adopted this way is recorded with its confidence, so a reader can see which are not native.
