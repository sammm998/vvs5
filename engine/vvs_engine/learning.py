"""What a correction is allowed to teach a later reading.

A person correcting one drawing has told us something true about that drawing. Carrying it to the next one is
where a takeoff system usually starts lying: the correction becomes a prior, the prior becomes a guess, and the
guess is indistinguishable from a reading. So the rule here is narrow and stated rather than learned.

A correction may only ever do one thing on a later sheet: settle a case the engine itself has already marked
AMBIGUOUS, in favour of the answer a person gave in the same situation. It may never create a run, never name
geometry no leader reached, never change a run the engine is confident about, and never outvote the drawing.

"The same situation" is not a resemblance score. It is an exact match on everything that makes the case what it
is, and every part of it is read off the drawing:

  * family_style      the pen the geometry is drawn with - width and colour, without the layer
  * leader_style      how this drawing draws the leader that reached the label - shape, ending, tick, width
  * reason            the reason the engine itself gave for stopping
  * designation_shape the shape of the name, letters and separators but not the numbers
  * topology          the local shape of the case: label rows in the block, compatible groups at the leader end,
                      and how many pieces of geometry the leader actually touched
  * candidate_shape   what the drawing offered as answers - how many, and of what shape

A lesson that matches on all six is a lesson about the same kind of case. Anything less and it does not apply,
because two sheets that merely look alike are two different drawings. Widening the fingerprint can only make
lessons speak less often, which is the direction that is safe to be wrong in. A correction recorded before a
part of it existed carries no lesson at all, and is left as a statement about its own drawing.
