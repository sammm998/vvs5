    A stacked label over a bundle says which codes are there and not which line is which. On a sheet that names
    a system on its own somewhere, elimination is enough. On a sheet that never does - one that puts KV, VV and
    VVC on two shared layers and labels them only in stacks - elimination has nothing to work from, and reading
    the order off a drawing convention would swap systems wherever that convention did not hold.

    But the sheet is not one bundle. It is dozens, and they run over the same pipes: a line belongs to one
    connected piece of geometry, that piece carries one system along its length, and every block that touches it
    names that system among its codes. So each piece can only be a system that appears in EVERY block reaching
    it, no two pieces in one block can be the same system, and a piece the reading already named is fixed. Where
    those three things leave a piece with one possible system, the sheet has said which it is - not a convention,
    not an order, but the only reading its own labels are all consistent with.

    On some sheets that is still not enough, and the reason is worth stating: where every block names the same
    systems over the same two pens, swapping two of those systems everywhere satisfies every constraint just as
    well. The sheet is then symmetric and nothing in its geometry says which of two parallel lines is the cold
    one. A person knows by convention, and convention is the guess this refuses.

    `known` is how that is broken without asking anyone: what the rest of the project has already stated, as
    drawn family -> system. A set of drawings is one office drawing one building, and the sheet that labels a
    run on its own says which pen that office uses for that system. Carried across, it is a fixpoint on the sheet
    that does not - and it is a fact taken from a drawing, not from a reader.
