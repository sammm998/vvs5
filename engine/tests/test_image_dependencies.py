"""The image must carry the system libraries the installed packages ask the loader for.

This was got wrong once by reasoning instead of looking: the OCR cross-check failed in the container, I said
onnxruntime needed libgomp, and it does not. What fails is OpenCV, which the recogniser imports and which links
against libGL and glib - neither of them in a slim Python image.

The image cannot be built here (the registry is blocked by the egress policy), so the claim is checked the only
way it can be: read what the Dockerfile installs, read what the packages actually need, and let the two disagree
out loud rather than in a deployment.
