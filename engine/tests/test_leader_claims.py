"""Which label a drawn line belongs to, when more than one could claim it.

A leader that goes to the wrong label - or to a block that is not a label at all - costs the right label its
pipe, and the pipe is then simply not marked. Two ways that happened, both found on real sheets:

  * the box a reading puts round a label is derived, not drawn, and one label's derived corner can fall nearer a
    line than the box the line actually ends on;
  * a drawing that rules its dimensions with filled bars has those bars read back as a row of their own, making a
    block three points tall that says nothing and sits exactly where the leader starts.
