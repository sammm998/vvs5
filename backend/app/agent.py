"""The agent that works against a finished reading.

The division the whole thing rests on: the model decides what to ask, the engine decides what the answer is.
Every number the agent says comes out of a tool call into the measuring pipeline's own artifacts, so an answer in
the chat and an answer in the takeoff table cannot disagree. The model never sees geometry it could invent from -
it sees the names of tools and the results they return.

A turn is bounded: at most a handful of tool rounds. Some tools propose a change rather than report a fact,
and a proposal is still only words: it says which correction it would write and what the reading says that would
cost, and nothing is recorded until a person accepts it. Accepting runs the same call again on the server and
writes what comes out, so the metres in the log are the reading's, never the model's.
